# Node Basic Authentication Examples

[![Build status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Code Climate][codeclimate-image]][codeclimate-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] [![Dependencies][david-image]][david-url]

This is a basic single-page web application that shows how to implement both
cookie and token based authentication in Node.js. The code is for illustrative
purposes only and if you need authentication, [Passport](http://passportjs.org)
is the solution you should look to.

Run the app with either:  
`AUTH='cookie' node index.js`  
`AUTH='token' node index.js`
